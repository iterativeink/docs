<Note>
Free API users are limited to a single page of results.
</Note>

Pagination helps manage large datasets by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pages. The Pulsedive API supports offset-based pagination for:

- search requests
- requests for linked indicators from threats or feeds

When a response includes more than 15,000 records, it is automatically split into multiple pages.

## How pagination works

If your request returns more than 15,000 results, the Pulsedive API includes pagination fields in the response:

- `page_current`: Current page number (starts at `0`)
- `page_next`: Page number for the next request, if additional results are available

Here's what the first page of a paginated response might look like:

```json
{
  "page_current": 0,
  "page_next": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "iid": 918421,
      "indicator": "185.220.100.255",
      "type": "ip",
      "risk": "low",
      "stamp_linked": "2018-11-18 11:46:55",
      "summary": {
        "properties": {
          ...
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

<Note>
If a response returns fewer than 15,000 results, pagination fields (`page_current`, `page_next`) are not included.
</Note>

## Requesting additional pages

To get the next page of results, resend the same request but set the page parameter to the value of `page_next` from your last response. Repeat this process until `page_next` is no longer returned&mdash;this means you’ve reached the end of the data.

### Example first request

```json
{
  "fid": "19",
  "get": "links",
  "pretty": "1",
  "key": "your_api_key"
}
```

### First response

```json
{
  "page_current": 0,
  "page_next": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "iid": 918421,
      "indicator": "185.220.100.255",
      "type": "ip",
      "risk": "low",
      "stamp_linked": "2018-11-18 11:46:55",
      "summary": {
        "properties": {
          ...
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Example second request

This request uses the value of `page_next` from the first response to populate the `page` parameter:

```json
{
  "fid": "19",
  "get": "links",
  "pretty": "1",
  "key": "your_api_key",
  "page": "1"
}
```

### Second response

```json
{
  "page_current": 1,
  "page_next": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "iid": 95352,
      "indicator": "191.20.101.211",
      "type": "domain",
      "risk": "medium",
      "stamp_linked": "2021-04-23 05:22:12",
      "summary": {
        "properties": {
          ...
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Continue making requests using the most recent `page_next` value until it is no longer present in the response.

<Note>
Each page contains up to 15,000 records. This limit is hard-coded.

## Troubleshooting

### Can I go back to a previous page?

No. Pagination is forward-only. You must request pages sequentially. If you skip a page or need to start over, begin again from page 0. 

### How do I know when I’ve reached the last page?

When the API stops returning a `page_next` value, you have reached the final page of results.

### Can I jump to a specific page?

Technically, you can request any numeric page, but skipping ahead or accessing pages out of order can lead to inconsistent results&mdash;especially if the dataset has changed between requests. For best results, always follow the sequence provided by `page_next`.
