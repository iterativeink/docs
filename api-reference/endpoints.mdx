TAXII requires users to authenticate via the HTTP Authorization header. 

HTTP Basic Authorization
This is the method that the TAXII specification requires. To authenticate, you must base64-encode your API key and supply it in the Authorization HTTP header.

Some libraries or tools require both a username and a password for HTTP Basic authorization. If this is the case, you may provide taxii2 as the username, in which case the base64-encoded value will be equivalent to taxii2:[API KEY] .

GET /taxii2/ HTTP/1.1
    ...
    Authorization: Basic [BASE64-ENCODED API KEY]
    Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1
    ...
